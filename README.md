# ProductCard-Component-Using-Props
Create a React component named ProductCard that accepts props for product name, price, and stock status. The component should display all three details clearly, for example in a card layout or a simple styled box. You should demonstrate how different product data can be passed into component and rendered dynamically without changing component code.
